# Bypass
I managed to create a bypass for the .exe that makes it impossible to find the process .exe it basically disables the UAC check, it has stream mode, 
and every 1ms it renames its .exe and its process name in taskmgr, I created this with the aim of bypass Valorant's vgc anti-cheat, 
I haven't had a chance to test it yet, but it should probably work.
